ZCA (My name) - .bat (the type of files involved) - repo (obvious lol) 

This is a repository for historical as well as knowledge purposes for new 
.bat coders as well as others. Most of these are "games" a few are tools and 
a few are tests. I started these in high school but I have gone and updated
them as well as added notes to help understand what one may be looking at.
