ZCA - .bat - repo

This repository serves both historical and educational purposes, particularly for those interested in .bat scripting. It contains a mix of .bat projects, including simple games, utility tools, and test scripts. 

Originally created while I was in high school, these scripts have since been updated and annoated to improve clarity and understanding. Whether you're a new batch coder or just exploring, this repository provides insight into batch file scripting with explanations to help you along the way.
